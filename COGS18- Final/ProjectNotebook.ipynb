    "This game allows for the player to experince the diffculties of the trail to the dragon, if they were to answer the trivia question incorrectly. You would only be given three lives to answer only 10 questions to get to the dragon. Along this path to the dragon there will be some obstacles that you would have to face, fatal or nonfatal, which will be determined on how many lives you have. If you are on your last life, meaning you got 2 questions incorrect then you will die from a fatal cause on your path. If you manage to have at least 1 life remaining when you answered 10 questions correctly you face the dragon. The dragon is meant to be a harder, free response, porition of the game. If you even fail to answer one of these 4 questions wrong you die. However, if you answer the 4 questions correctly then you save the town from the dragon. Also, as you answer each question correctly your rank will increase. You can get anything from a peasant, farmer, knight, black knight, or even dragon slayer along your jounrey. You will only be promoted to dragon slayer if you wish to fight and slay the dragon. "

    "2. I think my project went above and beyond because I think that i challeneged myself with making a trivia game associated with a story line. Making a game within a trivia took a lot of thinking and planning just so I don't get swamped with an exceessive amount of for loops and nested if else statements. I challeneged myself by trying to figure how to best store the story elements along with the questions so I wouldn't have to hard code each thing. Because I did this, it allows this game to become more scalable. Therefore, I can always add more and more questions hence allowing people to play this over and over again to get some more variety in their questions. Overall, jusy ensuring that everything needed to be printed in the according sections and there were no repeats in questions. It also took some time for me to figure out how to make both mutiple choice questions and free response questions work under the same class. It also took me a while to understand how to have the free reponse answers account for every possible answers the indivudal could type up and not compute it to False when it is in fact True. To add on, it did take a lot of time for me to think about story elements that would best fit my game and the different senarios that could play out if they got the questions right or wrong. I really had to take into account how many lives the player was at, at any given time and to best impliment what would happen next, hence the fatal and nonfatal scenes. "
